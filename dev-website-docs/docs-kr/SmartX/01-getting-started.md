## Step 1 - Write & Compile  

we have built the [Smartx](http://smartx.ont.io) to help you with all these things.
We now support smart contracts that run in **NeoVM**.

* **For NeoVM**, please refer [SmartX](http://smartx.ont.io) to write, compile, deploy, and invoke smart contracts. 

First, you create a project and choose a language you are good at to write your smart contract.

![Select language](http://wx2.sinaimg.cn/mw690/0060lm7Tly1fstjbsyc5uj30jd0dcaai.jpg)

Then you enter the main editor page and the middle area is the contract editor. The bottom area prints the running output and the right area is the operation panel.

### Write a smart contract

Now, you can enjoy coding your smart contracts and we provide some useful contract templates for you to start writing easily.

You can check more specific [examples](https://github.com/ontio/documentation/tree/master/smart-contract-tutorial/examples) here.

### Compile a smart contract

After you finish your smart contract, you can click the **Compile** button on the operation panel to compile your code. 

If your code is correct, your smart contract will be compiled to the ABI and AVM file, and will be displayed on the operation panel.

## Step 2 - Deploy a smart contract

Next, you can deploy the smart contract on the blockchain by clicking the **Deploy** button. If you choose to deploy the contract on the TestNet, it is free, that is, no gas will be consumed. The result of the deployment will be printed in the output box. You can copy the results of the transaction hash to the Ontology blockchain browser to further confirm the success of the deployment.

In addition to Smartx, you can use the Ontology SDK to deploy a contract. For more information, please refer to related documents.

## Step 3 - Invoke a smart contract

Last, you can run the method of your contract. You can select the method you want to run, enter the correct parameter value, click the **Run** button, and invoke the smart contract. The result of the invocation will be printed in the output box.

In addition to Smartx, you can use the Ontology SDK to deploy a contract. For more information, please refer to related documents.
