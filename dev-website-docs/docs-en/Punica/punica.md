### Getting Started

We recommend starting with the [Punica CLI tutorial](http://punica.ont.io/tutorials/How-to-use-Punica-Cli/) to help get you started.  Once you have installed Punica and get familiar with some of the Punica boxes you can start working on your own smart contract with our [SmartX](https://smartx.ont.io/) tool.
