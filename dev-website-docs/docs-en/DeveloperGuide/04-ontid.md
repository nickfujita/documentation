<p align="center" class="version">Version 0.7.0 </p>

## Overview

ONT ID establishes a cryptographic-based digital identity for any user, company, item, etc. The digital identity is based on Ontology blockchain technology and is not subject to any centralized organization. It is completely controlled by the user and is secure and trustworthy.

Once you create your ONT ID you will immediately have a blockchain-based digital identity. In order to make your ONT ID more credible and have more sources, you can authenticate and endorse your ONT ID through trusted sources in different fields, such as eID, CA, governments, institutions, schools, companies, communities, individuals, and so on. After authentication and authorization, you will have blockchain certificates from different identity trust sources (we call them â€œverifiable claims").
