<p align="center" class="version">Version 0.7.0 </p>

## Overview

In light of the pain points of the current centralized data exchanges, such as data caching, private data use without user authorization, data copyright protection, etc., Ontology launched the decentralized data transaction framework, “DDXF”. Ontology ecosystem application developers can develop decentralized data transaction applications based on DDXF to meet different scenarios and features, and support communication/transactions between data transaction platforms.

Based on the Ontology blockchain and ONT ID protocols, DDXF implements decentralized transactions of digital assets through consistent bookkeeping, smart contracts, and cryptography. DDXF provides a series of smart contract templates, transaction modules, and cryptography modules. Applications can also easily implement the requirements of copyright control, contractual data sharing, etc.


## Understand how DXF works

The main players in the distributed data exchange protocol are:
* Data consumer: Institutions/enterprises/individuals who need to purchase data;

* Data provider: The organization/enterprise/individual providing the data, the data can be source data or processed data, and the data supply needs to fully meet the local government's laws and regulations;

* Data owner: The data subject can be an institution, enterprise, individual, etc.;

* Marketplace: Operates a visual data transaction page or community, develops data transaction and exchange standards in the industry, and facilitates efficient trading between buyers and sellers and trading participants. There will be significant differences in data exchange standards across industries, so there will be different types of decentralized data exchanges.
