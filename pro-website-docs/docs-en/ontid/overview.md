## Why do I need to decentralize your identity?

On March 18th, 2018, US social media giant Facebook revealed that user information data of  more than 50 million users was leaked. On March 27th, Facebook CEO Zuckerberg published an article in a number of newspapers, publicly apologizing, admitting that they had hurt the trust of users. He said Facebook have a responsibility to protect your information, and if they can’t, they don't deserve it. They violated trust and are sorry that they didn't do more at the time. Of course, this scandal was only a concentrated outbreak of the problem. For the general public, Zuckerberg’s apology is merely an emotional expression. What is actually needed is to protect user data privacy through legal and technical methods, and to protect a healthy public domain network environment.

## What is ONT ID?

ONT ID establishes a cryptographic-based digital identity for any user, company, item, etc. The digital identity is based on Ontology blockchain technology and is not subject to any centralized organization. It is completely controlled by the user and is secure and trustworthy.

Once you create your ONT ID you will immediately have a blockchain-based digital identity. In order to make your ONT ID more credible and have more sources, you can authenticate and endorse your ONT ID through trusted sources in different fields, such as eID, CA, governments, institutions, schools, companies, communities, individuals, and so on. After authentication and authorization, you will have blockchain certificates from different identity trust sources (we call them “verifiable claims").

## Why do I need to integrate ONT ID?

* The power of an ecosystem that integrate the fragmented industries

The Ontology trust ecosystem has already been connected by global trust anchors (identity trust sources). They can authenticate ONT IDs and create multi-factor trusted certificates, which can help users prove their identity. Learn more about [trust anchors](https://info.ont.io/trust-anchor/en).

* User privacy protection

We use a variety of methods to help users protect their privacy. First, ONT ID generates complete attribute information (called DDO), such as a public key for each individual/organization, and registers this information to the blockchain (only the owner who owns the private key can control it). For the sake of privacy protection, the DDO on the blockchain does not contain any plaintext related to the real identity of the entity, but instead a ciphertext generated by the hash algorithm or other encryption algorithms. ONT ID also uses a zero-knowledge proof protocol and C-L signature algorithm to protect the privacy of the user. The data owner can choose which specific data be open, allowing specified data to be open for enhanced targeting, matching, and so on. For example, if an exchange wants to prove that a user has Chinese citizenship and an annual income exceeding 300,000 CNY, the user does not need to provide ID document photos and bank record information, but rather simply provides a Y/N credible proof result, greatly reducing user privacy exposure risks.


## Work principles

Before using ONT ID, you can first get an idea of how ONT ID works.

The following roles will be present throughout the use of ONT ID:

* **Recipient** The owner of the ONT ID, they can accept verifiable claims issued by verifiers, or issue verifiable claims to others.

* **Claim issuer** This can be any ONT ID holder in the Ontology ecosystem, including Ontology trust anchors (partners providing the certification service), which may be government agencies, universities, banks, or third-party certification services (such as CA), biometric technology companies, and so on. These companies provide multi-dimensional authentication for ONT ID owners and record authentication activity and result hash, thereby reaching service demands of the user while using a standardized, trusted way to authenticate.

* **Claim verifier** Receives the user's verifiable claim and verifies the case, such as with an employer who needs to verify the interviewer's identity information/education/industry skills.

* **Developer** Provide various application development services for different users and scenarios using the ONT ID protocol and interface.

## Understanding the ONT ID protocol

The ONT ID protocol system consists of two parts: the Ontology DID and the verifiable claim protocol.

Ontology DID is a decentralized identity protocol based on [W3C](https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/WG/) [DID](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/) specification. Ontology's ONT ID creates and manage on-chain identities using this protocol.

A verifiable claim is a statement made by an entity of certain attributes of another entity (including itself). It includes the entity's own digital signature to prove the authenticity of these attributes, which can be used by other entities for verification purposes. The verifiable claim protocol details the procedures and specifications for the issuance, storage, verification, and so on of the statement. The Ontology verifiable claim protocol establishes a decentralized trust model and a distributed trust delivery system, and introduces cryptographic techniques such as the C-L signature algorithm and sigma protocol to assure privacy protection of verifiable claims.

## Trust anchor

Trust anchors are partners that provide certification services in the Ontology ecosystem. They may be government agencies, universities, banks, third-party certification service organizations (such as CA), biometric technology companies, etc. We welcome you to join the Ontology ecosystem and build up the distributed trust chain network.
